    "\"\"\"Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose\n",
    "you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam\n",
    "scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam \n",
    "and their final exam scores is 0.75. This indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the two \n",
    "variables, meaning that as the amount of time spent studying increases, so does the final exam score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables.\n",
    "Suppose you have collected data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job\n",
    "satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10. Calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between these two\n",
    "variables and interpret the result.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and\n",
    "their overall job satisfaction level is 0.45. This indicates that there is a moderate, positive correlation\n",
    "between the two variables, meaning that as the amount of sleep increases, job satisfaction also increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that getting enough sleep is important for job satisfaction, but other factors may also be \n",
    "at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3. Suppose you are conducting a study to examine the relationship between the number of hours of\n",
    "exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) in a sample of adults. You collected data on both variables\n",
    "for 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation\n",
    "between these two variables and compare the results.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Pearson correlation coefficient: The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear \n",
    "relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, with -1 indicating a perfect negative linear \n",
    "relationship, 0 indicating no linear relationship, and +1 indicating a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "In this case, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of hours of exercise per week and BMI\n",
    "is 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman's rank correlation: Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship \n",
    "between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, with -1 indicating a perfect negative monotonic \n",
    "relationship, 0 indicating no monotonic relationship, and +1 indicating a perfect positive monotonic \n",
    "relationship. In this case, the Spearman's rank correlation between the number of hours of exercise per \n",
    "week and BMI is 0.27.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation are both measures of the \n",
    "relationship between two variables. However, they measure different types of relationships. The Pearson \n",
    "correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables, while the Spearman's rank \n",
    "correlation measures the monotonic relationship between two variables. In this case, the Pearson \n",
    "correlation coefficient is slightly lower than the Spearman's rank correlation, indicating that there is \n",
    "a weak positive linear relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4. A researcher is interested in examining the relationship between the number of hours individuals\n",
    "spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity. The researcher collected data on\n",
    "both variables from a sample of 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between\n",
    "these two variables.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables can be calculated using the formula: \n",
    "r = (∑xy - (∑x)(∑y)/n) / √[(∑x2 - (∑x)2/n)(∑y2 - (∑y)2/n)]\n",

    "∑x = the sum of all x values \n",

    "∑xy = the sum of all xy values \n",
    "∑x2 = the sum of all x2 values \n",
    "∑y2 = the sum of all y2 values \n",
    "n = the number of observations \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables is: \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: From the survey results, it appears that there is a correlation between age and preference for a \n",
    "particular brand of soft drink. The majority of respondents aged 25, 28, and 37 preferred Coke, while the\n",
    "majority of respondents aged 19, 31, and 42 preferred Pepsi.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note, however, that this survey only included six respondents and may not be \n",
    "representative of the general population. Therefore, further research would be needed to determine if \n",
    "there is a significant relationship between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink.\n",
